## About
This project contains 2 parts:
1. Smart contracts. This is a simple waffle project with smart contracts that can be deployed to the different chains using scripts. For more details refer to <a href='/smart-contracts#readme'>this</a>.
2. Subgraph: This contain the subgraph which can be deployed to various blockchain networks. For more instructions refer to <a href='/subgraph#readme'>this</a>.

## Supported blockchain networks:
1. Ethereum Goerli testnet
2. Polygon Mumbai testnet
3. Optimism Goerli testnet
4. Avalanche FUJI testnet
5. Fantom testnet
6. Moonbase Alpha - Moonbeam's testnet
